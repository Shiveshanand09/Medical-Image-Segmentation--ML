## 1. Overview

Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision where the goal is to partition an image into meaningful regions, assigning a label to every pixel. This project demonstrates how to implement **U-Net**, a deep learning architecture designed for pixel-wise image segmentation.

U-Net has been particularly effective in biomedical image segmentation but can also generalize to other segmentation problems. The model captures both global context and fine details, making it suitable for high-resolution image processing.

## 2. Key Features

This project covers the following key aspects:
1. **U-Net Model Implementation**: An end-to-end implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation.
2. **Custom Dataset Compatibility**: The notebook allows easy integration with custom datasets.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Built-in image augmentation for training robustness.
4. **Training and Validation**: The model trains on provided image-mask pairs, displaying accuracy and loss metrics for evaluation.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Segmentation quality is measured using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice coefficient.
6. **Visualization**: Model predictions are visualized by overlaying the predicted masks on the original images.
7. **Custom Loss Function**: A combined loss function using Binary Cross-Entropy and Dice Loss is employed for improved segmentation results.
8. **Performance Plots**: Training/validation loss and accuracy curves are plotted to monitor performance.
9. **Transferability**: The project can be easily extended to multi-class segmentation and different datasets.
10. **Result Comparison**: Segmentation results are displayed alongside ground truth masks for easy comparison.

## 3. U-Net Architecture

The U-Net architecture follows a symmetric structure with an **encoder-decoder** setup:
- **Encoder**: The encoder consists of repeated application of convolution and max-pooling, reducing the image size while increasing the number of feature channels.
- **Decoder**: The decoder upsamples the image back to its original size using transpose convolutions, restoring spatial resolution.
- **Skip Connections**: Skip connections are used between corresponding layers of the encoder and decoder to retain spatial information lost during downsampling.

## 4. Loss Function

The model uses a custom loss function that combines:
- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**: Measures the per-pixel classification error.
- **Dice Loss**: Helps capture overlapping regions between the predicted mask and the ground truth, improving segmentation performance for imbalanced datasets.

The combined loss function encourages the model to improve overlap with ground truth segmentation masks.

## 5. Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Dataset
The project supports custom datasets. Each dataset should consist of images and corresponding segmentation masks.

Folder Structure:
images/: Directory containing the input images.
masks/: Directory containing the ground truth segmentation masks.
Ensure that both directories are well-organized, and the filenames of the images correspond to their masks.

8. Training the Model
The training procedure consists of the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Images and masks are resized, normalized, and augmented. Augmentation includes random rotations, flips, and shifts to make the model more robust.
Model Training: The U-Net model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained using the combined loss function (BCE + Dice Loss).
Metrics: The performance of the model is monitored using IoU and Dice coefficient during training.
Training is done in batches, and training/validation loss and accuracy curves are plotted to assess the model's learning process.
